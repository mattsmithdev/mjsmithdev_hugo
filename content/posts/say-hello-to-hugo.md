MjSmithDev.com is dead, long live MjSmithDev.com! After 4 years I finally decided to do something about this code blog.

First step was moving away from Jekyll and Github pages to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static site generation and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the hosting. There is nothing wrong with Jekyll and Github pages, I just played around with the Hugo/Netlify setup before and really enjoyed it. I'm also using [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) as the backend CMS to make it easier to manage the blog posts/images/etc.

The old posts centered around [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) are now no more. They still get traffic 4 years later, but it's time to move on with some updated content.
