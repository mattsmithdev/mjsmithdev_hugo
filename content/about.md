![Matt Smith](/uploads/matt-smith-dev.jpg)Hi, everybody! To all one of you reading this let me just say - stop! Go doing something more productive or fun with your life. If you really must continue reading I'll give you the two second intro...

Hi, I'm Matt Smith. One of the many, many Smiths (we're a big family). I'm a developer in Pennsylvania, USA. I've got a family, two dogs, and two rabbits (anyone want some rabbits?).

I've been a developer for more years than it's worth mentioning here. I mostly work on .net, JavaScript, and Angular in the fintech industry. I also enjoy the startup scene and I'm constantly coming up with things I want to work on. Here's my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattsmithdev "Matt Smith Dev") if you want to see the whole history.

Anyway, now go outside and run around in the rain (just not during thunderstorms). It's a real hoot.
